Welcome to DEFAULT PROJECT!

This project contains my vision of a default JUCE VST plugin project. I made this so I can get started trying new ideas
and finishing projects way faster than from a projucer-made template.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO USE:

1. Copy the folder "Source" as well as the file "Project.jucer" into a new folder.
2. In Project.jucer
	2.1 Rename plugin name
	2.2 Define unique plugin ID
3. Open config.h and define the needed pro processor definitions
4. Open LowLevel.h and define all low level parameters, layout and stuff
5. Ship it!


-------------------------------------------------------------------

TO DO:

Knob & Scollbar
	..

Shader
	..

ScrollBar
	some things still not handled by scrollbarcomp alone
	enable scrolling not only on scrollbar hover

PatchBrowser
	remake tag system
		1. vector of all existent tags exists
		2. patch has vector of tags

		1. every patch has list of tags (inspector)
			click on tag to select
		2. every tag has
			name / id
			being selectable
			edit-button for editting tag (spawns texteditor)
			trash-button for removing selected tag
		3. texteditor for adding tag to patch (inspector)
			
		4. tagSelectorComponent where tags can be selected
			checks all patches for tags to fill list
		5. on updates and on construction
			update is adding or removing tag to patch
			selection makes patches visible
			no tags selected: all patches visible

		adding tags via plus-button in inspector
	don't load all existing patches into memory, but only the visible one(e)
		or unique_ptr for heap
	actually serialize patches

FormularParser
	is log and ln working right?
	make more lightweight
		values push_backs in calculate and calculateX needed?

Param
	...

ParameterRandomizer
	...

Comp
	...

TextEditor
	minimize > back > click > tick doesn't move > 2nd click > does move
	fast repeated "back" hits not always registered

sta::State
	contains valueTree as well as ApplicationProperties for max workflow!
	implement undo/redo

MIDI Learn
	1 cc to n parameters?
	different midi channnels (16 * 128 CCs instead of 128)
	possible to save and load default state of whole midi learn patch

ScrollBar
	finish
	make vertical
	have own header/cpp

PopUp
	rename to context menu
	implement context menu(s) for
		ccMonitor

Label
	make free func(s) for grouping labels (n buttons)

Options Menu
	think about how to make automatic tutorials or manuals
	how to make automatic updates possible

All Params
	saving and loading max mod depths as preset

Param
	...

Oversampler
	less cpu demanding (FFT?)

FirstTimeAction
	thing that only makes lookuptables when the plugin is started the first time
	tutorial

ProcessorBase
	...

LowLevel UI Elements
	...

Pre Processor Defines (PPD)
	PPDSidechainable

HighLevel UI Elements
	undo/redo buttons
	sidechain activated?

	...

Knob
	...
